## Alcohol Consumption per Adult (Age 15+)

Here I investigate a dataset downloaded from [Gapminder](https://www.gapminder.org/data/). The dataset contains the average alcohol consumption per adult in litres for 189 countries for years ranging from 1985-2008. Most of the data comes from the World Health Origanization, with some data estimated or pulled from other sources. Follow [this link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UTd3D_D89fViE_ZN5wnIiemv2dyhtTS-92qIv_lJhcI/pub#) for more information on the data set.

### Data Exploration

The report is a simple exploration of the data to see any trends. I begin by tidying and manipulating the data using tidyr. Through plots and subsetting the data I try to explore any relationships there may be, including overall alcohol use by year and alcohol use over the years in Russia and Sweden.

### R Packages Used

- tidyr
- dplyr
- ggplot2
